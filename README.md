ZHive Index Page - Code Explanation
HTML Structure
The page uses HTML with three main sections:

Header: Contains a sticky navigation bar with logo, links to all pages, and an active state indicator on the current page.

Main Content:

Hero Section: A centered banner with headline, tagline, and call-to-action button directing users to the shop
Featured Products: A responsive product grid displaying 3 featured items
Shop by Category: Three category cards linking to Men's, Women's, and Accessories pages
Footer: Copyright and project information.

CSS Styling
Layout: Uses CSS Grid (grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr))) for responsive product cards that adapt from 1 to 4 columns based on screen size.

Colors: Dark theme with gold accents (#D4AF37) for luxury feel.

Interactions:

Smooth transitions on hover effects
Cards lift slightly (transform: translateY(-3px))
Buttons change background/text colors on hover
Gold box shadow on product card hover
Typography: 'Playfair Display' for headings (serif, premium) and 'Inter' for body text (clean, readable).

The design prioritizes luxury aesthetics with smooth animations and consistent spacing throughout.
